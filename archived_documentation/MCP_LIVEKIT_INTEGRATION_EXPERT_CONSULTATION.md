# MCP-LiveKit Agent Integration Expert Consultation

## Problem Statement

We successfully implemented MCP (Model Context Protocol) server management with a reliable status system and LiveKit OpenAI Realtime API voice agent functionality. However, when attempting to integrate MCP tools into the LiveKit agent, the agent fails to start due to Python import and module resolution issues, preventing voice conversations from working.

## Current System Architecture

### Working Components
1. **MCP Server Management**: Full CRUD operations, health monitoring, real connectivity tests
2. **LiveKit Voice Agent**: OpenAI Realtime API integration with proper fallback to STT-LLM-TTS
3. **Database Integration**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM, proper schema design
4. **Frontend Interface**: React configuration UI with real-time status updates

### Failed Integration Point
The LiveKit Python agent crashes on startup when MCP modules are imported, preventing any voice interaction.

## Technical Analysis

### Agent Startup Flow
```
1. Express server starts Python agent: `python agent.py dev`
2. Agent imports MCP modules: mcp_manager, mcp_tools, storage
3. Import errors occur due to relative import issues
4. Agent process exits with code 1
5. No voice functionality available
```

### Import Error Details
```python
# Error in agent.py line 12
from mcp_manager import MCPManager
# Causes: ImportError in server/mcp_manager.py line 7
from .mcp_client import MCPServer, MCPServerStdio, MCPServerHttp
# Error: attempted relative import with no known parent package
```

### Current File Structure
```

├── agent.py                    # LiveKit agent entry point
├── server/

```

## Expert Questions

### 1. Python Module Architecture
**Question**: What is the correct way to structure Python modules for a LiveKit agent that needs to import server-side MCP components?

**Context**: 
- Agent runs as `python agent.py dev` from workspace root
- Server modules use relative imports internally
- `sys.path.append('./server')` doesn't resolve relative import conflicts

**Options to Evaluate**:
- Convert to absolute imports throughout
- Create proper Python package structure with `__init__.py`
- Use different import strategy in agent.py
- Separate MCP functionality into standalone package

### 2. LiveKit Agent + MCP Integration Pattern
**Question**: What is the recommended architecture for integrating external tools/services (like MCP) with LiveKit agents?

**Current Approach**:
```python
class Assistant(Agent):
    async def initialize_mcp(self, user_id: int = 1):
        # Load MCP servers from database
        # Convert MCP tools to LiveKit function tools
        # Add tools to agent dynamically
```

**Concerns**:
- Should MCP initialization happen before or after agent session start?
- How to handle MCP connection failures gracefully?
- Best practice for dynamic tool loading in LiveKit agents?

### 3. Database Integration in Agent Context
**Question**: How should a LiveKit agent access database resources when the main application uses TypeScript/Drizzle but agent is Python?

**Current Challenges**:
- Agent needs to read MCP server configurations from PostgreSQL
- TypeScript storage interface vs Python database access
- Shared database schema between Node.js app and Python agent

**Potential Solutions**:
- Create Python equivalent of storage interface
- Use REST API calls from agent to Express server
- Direct database connection from Python agent
- Share database access through environment/config

### 4. Error Handling and Fallback Strategy
**Question**: How should the agent handle MCP integration failures while maintaining voice functionality?

**Requirements**:
- Agent must start successfully even if MCP servers are down
- Voice conversations should work without MCP tools
- Graceful degradation when MCP tools become unavailable
- Clear error reporting to user interface

### 5. Development vs Production Deployment
**Question**: What are the deployment considerations for MCP-enabled LiveKit agents?

**Current Setup**:
- Development: Direct Python execution with file imports
- Dependencies: livekit-agents, openai plugins, database clients
- MCP protocols: HTTP/WebSocket for external servers, stdio for local

**Considerations**:
- Package management for MCP dependencies
- Environment variable management
- Containerization strategy
- Health monitoring integration

## Expected Outcomes

### Immediate Goals
1. **Agent Startup**: Resolve import issues to allow agent initialization
2. **MCP Integration**: Successfully load and use MCP tools in voice conversations
3. **Error Resilience**: Agent works with or without MCP availability
4. **User Experience**: Seamless voice interaction with external tool capabilities

### Long-term Architecture
1. **Scalable Integration**: Easy addition of new MCP servers through UI
2. **Performance**: Minimal latency impact from MCP tool usage
3. **Monitoring**: Full observability of MCP tool performance in conversations
4. **Security**: Proper authentication and authorization for MCP services

## Current Workaround

```python
# Temporarily disabled MCP to fix agent startup
# from mcp_manager import MCPManager
# from mcp_tools import MCPToolsIntegration
# from storage import DatabaseStorage

async def initialize_mcp(self, user_id: int = 1):
    logger.info("MCP initialization temporarily disabled")
    return []
```

This allows the voice agent to function for basic conversations but removes all external tool capabilities that MCP servers provide.
