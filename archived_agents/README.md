# Archived Agent Variations

This folder contains previous iterations and experimental versions of the LiveKit voice agent implementations. These files represent the evolution of the MCP integration system.

## Current Active Agent
- `../agent.py` - Production agent with enhanced MCP integration and result polling

## Archived Variations

### Core Development Iterations
- `agent_old.py` - Original implementation with basic MCP integration
- `agent_corrected.py` - Early fix attempt for MCP tool access
- `agent_fixed.py` - Intermediate version with improved error handling

### Enhanced MCP Implementations
- `agent_enhanced.py` - Enhanced version with result polling mechanism
- `agent_working_mcp.py` - Working MCP manager with API proxy integration
- `agent_dynamic_mcp.py` - Dynamic MCP server loading from database

### Architecture Experiments
- `agent_universal.py` - Universal MCP architecture following Gemini's design
- `agent_universal_simple.py` - Simplified universal MCP implementation
- `agent_native_mcp.py` - Native LiveKit MCP integration attempt
- `agent_mcp_native.py` - Alternative native MCP approach
- `agent_multimodal.py` - Multimodal agent with MCP integration

## Notes
- These files document the progression from basic MCP integration to the current enhanced polling system
- Each variation addressed specific challenges in the MCP integration journey
- The current active agent combines learnings from all these iterations
