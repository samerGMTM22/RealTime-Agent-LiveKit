- Agent configuration and customization
- Conversation history tracking
- System status monitoring

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+ and Python 3.11+
- LiveKit Cloud account or self-hosted LiveKit server
- OpenAI API key with Realtime API access

### Environment Setup

1. Copy your API keys to `.env`:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
LIVEKIT_API_KEY=your_livekit_api_key
LIVEKIT_API_SECRET=your_livekit_secret
LIVEKIT_URL=your_livekit_ws_url
YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your_youtube_api_key
```

### Running the Application

1. **Start the Node.js server**:
```bash
npm run dev
```

2. **Test the Python voice agent**:
```bash
python agent.py console
```

3. **Start a voice session**:
   - Open the web interface
   - Click "Start Session"
   - The Python agent will automatically join the room
   - Begin speaking to interact with the AI assistant

## System Components

### Python Voice Agent (`agent.py`)
- Implements proper LiveKit Agents framework
- Uses OpenAI Realtime API for speech processing
- Includes custom tools for channel information
- Handles room connections and voice interactions

### Node.js API Server
- Manages LiveKit room creation and tokens
- Provides agent configuration endpoints
- Handles conversation history
- Integrates with YouTube API for channel data

### React Frontend
- Voice interface with audio visualization
- Agent configuration and settings
- Real-time connection status
- Conversation history display

## Voice Agent Tools

The Python agent includes several specialized tools:

- **`get_channel_info()`**: Provides information about the Give Me the Mic channel
- **`get_music_tips(topic)`**: Offers music-related advice for singing, recording, instruments, etc.
- **`suggest_content(interest)`**: Recommends channel content based on user interests

## Deployment

### Development Mode
```bash
python agent.py dev
```

### Production Mode
```bash
python agent.py start
```

The agent automatically connects to LiveKit rooms created by the web application and provides voice responses using OpenAI's Realtime API.

## Customization

### Adding New Agent Types
1. Create templates in `server/config/agent-config.ts`
2. Define custom tools in the Python agent
3. Update the frontend configuration forms

### Business Templates
The system supports various business use cases:
- Music education and coaching
- Customer service automation
- Real estate assistance
- Fitness and wellness coaching

## Technical Details

### Voice Processing Pipeline
1. User speaks â†’ LiveKit captures audio
2. Audio streams to Python agent
3. OpenAI Realtime API processes speech
4. AI generates response speech
5. Response streams back to user via LiveKit

### Integration Points
- **LiveKit WebRTC**: Real-time audio communication
- **OpenAI Realtime API**: Speech-to-speech processing
- **YouTube API**: Channel data integration
- **Custom Tools**: Business-specific functionality

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Agent not connecting**: Check LiveKit credentials in `.env`
2. **No voice response**: Verify OpenAI API key has Realtime API access
3. **Audio issues**: Ensure microphone permissions are granted

### Debug Mode
Run the Python agent with verbose logging:
```bash
python agent.py dev --verbose
```
